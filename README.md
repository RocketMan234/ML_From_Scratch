# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository is dedicated to implementing various machine learning algorithms in Python from scratch, using only numpy for mathematical operations. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of algorithms, demonstrating a deep understanding of their mechanics and applications.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to gradually introduce more complex algorithms, starting from basic ones like Linear Regression, and progressing to advanced models like Neural Networks and Transformers. Each algorithm is self-contained, with its own documentation and examples. The repository is designed to be both a learning resource and a demonstration of coding and machine learning skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RocketMan234/ML_From_Scratch.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd ML_From_Scratch
```

3. Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
- Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is located in its respective directory (e.g., `regression`, `classification`). To use an algorithm, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the algorithm-specific README.

## Algorithm Roadmap

This section outlines the planned development and implementation of various machine learning algorithms. The project is divided into phases, starting with simpler algorithms and progressing to more complex ones.

### Phase 1 - Basics
- Linear Regression
